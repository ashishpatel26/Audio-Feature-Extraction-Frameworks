4. #### [spafe](https://github.com/SuperKogito/spafe)

![](https://github.com/SuperKogito/spafe/raw/master/logo.jpg)

spafe aims to simplify features extractions from mono audio files. The library can extract of the following features: ***BFCC, LFCC, LPC, LPCC, MFCC, IMFCC, MSRCC, NGCC, PNCC, PSRCC, PLP, RPLP, Frequency-stats*** etc. It also provides various filterbank modules (Mel, Bark and Gammatone filterbanks) and other spectral statistics.

## User installation

If you already have a working installation of numpy and scipy, you can simply install spafe using pip:

```
pip install -U spafe
```

or conda (*not available at the moment*):

```python
conda install spafe
```

kapre: Keras Audio Preprocessors

## Installation

```python
pip install kapre
```

6. #### [friture](https://github.com/tlecomte/friture)

   ![](http://friture.org/images/friture-logo.png)

**Friture** is an application to visualize and analyze live audio data in real-time.

Friture displays audio data in several widgets, such as a scope, a spectrum analyzer, or a rolling 2D spectrogram.

This program can be useful to analyze and equalize the audio response of a hall, or for educational purposes, etc.

The name *Friture* is a french word for *frying*, also used for *noise* in a sound.
